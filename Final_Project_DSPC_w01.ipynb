    "We need to take the decision of where is the best location to open a new restaurant of a certain cuisine (e.g. Italian, Japanese, Spanish, etc). Which are the cities with a highest potential based on the level of concentration of certain cuisine and the demand of each cuisine based also on the assessment of the existing restaurants? If possible, provide with a recommendation for the location of the restaurant and the cuisine that would be likely to be more successful."
